    challenges: `
      One of the main challenges in developing Hajir Khata was creating a system that could handle various attendance scenarios while maintaining accuracy in payroll calculations. We needed to account for different work schedules, overtime, leaves, and holidays.
      
      Another challenge was ensuring the application remained responsive and performant even with large datasets, as some businesses would need to track hundreds of employees simultaneously.
    `,
    solutions: `
      To address these challenges, we implemented a flexible rule-based system that allows businesses to define their own attendance and payroll policies. This made the application adaptable to different business needs.
      
      For performance optimization, we used efficient data structures and implemented pagination and lazy loading techniques to ensure the application remains responsive even with large datasets.

    challenges: `
    Ensuring data consistency across inventory, invoicing, and transaction modules:
    We needed atomic updates so that stock levels, invoices, and ledger entries always remained in sync.

    Handling high volumes of daily transactions without performance degradation:
    Queries needed heavy optimization and caching to serve large datasets quickly.

    Supporting diverse tax jurisdictions and compliance reporting:
    The system must be flexible enough to model various tax rules and generate region-specific reports.

    Implemented database transactions with strict referential integrity to guarantee consistency.
    Optimized tables with appropriate indexes, added caching layers for frequently used data, and paginated large result sets.
    Built a dynamic tax engine allowing admins to configure tax rules per product/region and generate compliance-ready exports.
